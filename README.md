# ImageGalleryApp
A mobile app that displays recent images from Flickr on the homepage, with a left navbar featuring a "Home" option. The app utilizes image caching to retain the last viewed images even when offline, and refreshes the view when the API response changes. Built using React Native and Flickr API.
